# Tesla Dashcam Viewer App

A lightweight, browser-based Tesla dashcam viewer I vibe-coded to help myself and fellow Tesla owners easily browse saved footage.

## Features

✅ View all **6 camera angles** simultaneously — including the newly added **B-pillar** feeds.

✅ **Select an entire folder** and quickly jump between clips using the built-in timeline.

✅ **Playback controls**: fast forward, rewind, play/pause, and change speeds (0.5×, 1×, 2×, 5×).

✅ Parses Tesla's `event.json` to display metadata like **timestamp**, **approximate location**, and **event reason**.

✅ **Runs locally**, easy to install, and 100% free to use.

✅ **Full-quality video** — uses original high-res USB files, unlike compressed versions from the Tesla app.
