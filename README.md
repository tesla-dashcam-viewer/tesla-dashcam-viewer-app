Tesla Dashcam Viewer

Lightweight browser-based Tesla dashcam viewer I vibe-coded to help myself & other Tesla owners more easily view saved footage.

Features:
:white_check_mark: Simultaneously view all 6 angles, including the recently added B-pillar video feeds.
:white_check_mark: Select a entire directory and skip around different segments using built-in timeline.
:white_check_mark: Supports fast forward, go back, play/pause, or even change viewing speeds (0.5x, 1x, 2x, 5x).
:white_check_mark: Reads from Tesla-generated event.json file to populate metadata such as time, approx location, and reason for triggering.
:white_check_mark: Locally run, easy to install, free for everyone to use.
:white_check_mark: Full quality. Unlike the mobile app downloads, this one relies on original full-quality files from your USB.
